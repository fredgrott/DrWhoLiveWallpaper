# Project Name

DrWhoLiveWallpaper is an example LiveWallpaper Android Application. It re-uses
Richard Green's GLWallpaper example from:
http://www.rbgrn.net/content/354-glsurfaceview-adapted-3d-live-wallpapers

Basically, I am creating a 3d tunnel in openGL and applying a 2d texture to
get the DRWho effect when its animated. The animation can be anything I choose
just some degrees on each axis to make it happen.

# Project Lead

# Credits

Original credit goes to Richard Green for the GLWallpaperService example which I
extended to derive this DrWhoLiveWallpaper. And credit goes to the original
authors of GLSurfaceView which is the original source of code used in
GLWallpaperService.
